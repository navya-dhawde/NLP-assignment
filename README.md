# NLP Assignment - Movie Review Polarity Classifier

## Overview
This project implements a polarity classifier for movie reviews using Support Vector Machine (SVM) techniques. The classifier is trained on the Cornell Movie Review Dataset to categorize reviews as either positive or negative sentiments.

## Installation

### Software and Package Requirements
- **Python Version**: 3.8+
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Required to run the project notebooks.

### Libraries Used
Install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk
```
## Usage

### Instructions to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/navya-dhawde/NLP-assignment.git
   ```
2. **Open Jupyter Notebook** Launch Jupyter Notebook in the project directory by entering the
   following command in you terminal:
   ```bash
   Jupyter Notebook
   ```
3. **Run the Notebooks:** Open the Jupyter Notebook files (NLPassg.ipynb) and run each cell in order to execute the code.
   The first few cells will handle data loading and preprocessing, while subsequent cells will train the model and evaluate its performance.

4. **View Results:** After executing the cells, you can view the performance metrics and visualizations generated within
   the notebooks.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of SVMs for binary sentiment classification using TF-IDF feature extraction. While the classifier performs well, there are opportunities to further improve performance by enhancing feature engineering and tuning the model with more advanced techniques.
